As much as we’re hungry for change, many of us do not have the energy to make big, sweeping shifts; and even if we did, it’s entirely possible that the world will have other plans.So, what little things can we do to feel better right now? This January, Guardian Australia staff and contributors embarked on a month of easy wins – sharing the small discoveries and changes that improved their lives. Some involved giving back, some giving yourself a break, and a few involved personal admin – because if you just need to achieve something, anything, you can always turn to paperwork.Toilet poll: your favourite Australian public loos, from architectural wonders to a ‘magnificent pissoir’Read moreIf you’re looking for somewhere to start, treat this as an incrementalist, feelgood laundry list. Try one, or try the lot – whatever feels easy for you.Give yourself a break1. Do something nice for yourself first thing in the morning. Whether your bliss looks like a bubble bath, a good book, a run or a video game, make it the first thing you do when you wake up, even if it’s only for five minutes.2. Chronic people-pleasers, listen to this one: write a not-to-do list. When you find yourself trapped in a commitment you loathe, write it down. Keeping a list will help you remember to say no next time.3. Dress like a seven-year-old. It’s fun, it saves you from fashion agony, and no one knows what to wear now anyway.Improve your health and wellbeing4. Extend your on-foot commute. Getting off the bus a stop or two early will certainly lift your step count, and it might just lift your spirits too.5. Want to cut down on booze? Impose alcohol-free days. A hard rule about when you can’t drink will give your body a break, and might make you more mindful on the days you do indulge.6. Remember caffeine has a quarter life of 10-12 hours, so it’s best to stop drinking it after midday. Cutting out afternoon coffee and tea is a game-changer for troubled sleepers. And if you’re really lucky, you could even replace that 2pm piccolo with a nap.Small exercises, like stretches before bed or pelvic floor routines, can make a big difference. Illustration: Guardian Design7. Do kegels while the kettle boils. For men and women, a strong pelvic floor is core to all sorts of bodily functions (including fun ones like orgasms). Look after yours by incorporating a few minutes of exercises into your existing routine – you can do them anywhere.8. If you’re having problems like acne, dryness or redness, treat your skin like what it is – the largest organ in your body – and ask your doctor for help. A scientifically sound skincare plan might involve a script or two, but it will be more effective (and maybe cheaper) in the long run than experimenting willy-nilly at the cosmetics counter.‘You’ll get a six-pack’: a beginner’s guide to kayakingRead more9. You don’t have to sit still to meditate. Much like pelvic floor exercises, meditation can be incorporated into all sorts of daily activities. “When you give something the awareness and concentration to realise its causes and effects, that is meditation,” writes Bertin Huynh.10. Do a cooldown without the workout. You’ll benefit from a few stretches or mobility exercises any time of day, but they’re particularly good before bed.11. Speaking of nighttime routines, read for six minutes before bed.One-and-done wins12. Renegotiate a bill. We might think loyalty is a trait to be rewarded, but when it comes to your utilities, insurance and other regular bills, it can be costly.. Contact your provider and call them out for it.With each instruction from your smooth-talking Irish Siri, you may feel your cortisol levels decline. Illustration: Guardian Design13. For an instant drop in stress levels, switch your Siri to the voice of an Irish man. It just sounds so much nicer.14. This one is a bit of a pain at first, but the rewards are ongoing: set up a password manager. You’ll never have to remember a stack of random passwords again – or worse yet, use the same one for everything.15. Consolidate your superannuation. It takes less than five minutes and could compound into a more comfortable retirement.16. Keep your memories private by archiving your social media history. It will allow you to hide whatever you want from prying eyes, while still retaining a copy for your own records.Culinary achievements17. Buy imperfect produce. It may not look as cute, but it’s cheaper, better for the planet and tastes just the same.18. If your pantry is causing you panic, clear it out one shelf at a time. An orderly and decluttered fridge or store cupboard will make your life more pleasant, but that doesn’t mean you have to do it all at once.19. Learn to make chilli oil. It goes with basically everything.Meal planning, gardening and writing down recipes can save time in the kitchen and in the supermarket. Illustration: Guardian Design20. While you’re at it, learn to make dal. It’s healthy, easy and freezes well – so a pot tonight is a gift for your future self.21. Plant an edible garden. Nothing tastes better than food you’ve grown yourself, and you’ll only need to tend to it five minutes a day.22. Instead of frantically Googling what to cook for dinner every night, keep a written copy of your favourite recipes on file.I interviewed hundreds of people in search of the perfect routine. I realised there isn’t oneRead more23. Or, prepare even further in advance and meal plan before you go grocery shopping. It’ll prevent that weird situation where your pantry is “simultaneously full of food … without the constituent parts to make a decent meal”.Saving time (and money)24. If you miss having a coin jar that actually gets full, set up a round-up savings account.25. Find a good tailor. Your clothes will look better because they fit better, and they’ll last longer because they’ll be fixed when they break.A throwaway email account can help you avoid a deluge of unwanted offers each morning. Illustration: Guardian Design26. You can’t mindlessly scroll what you can’t open: delete your social media apps from your phone.27. Set up a throwaway email. Rather than climbing a mountain of unsubscribe buttons, if you use a different email address for commercial transactions, you’ll never have to deal with the ensuing spam.28. Keep yourself organised the old fashioned way, and use a no frills, lo-fi notebook.Reconnect and give backGiving blood is a straight-forward way to make a difference. Illustration: Guardian Design29. Get in touch with an old friend. A weird time to be alive is a good time to reach out – don’t worry if you’re in email debt or missed their last birthday, they probably feel the same way.30. Directly help someone with something your body makes for free, by giving blood. How else can you save three lives in 10 minutes?31. Set up a monthly charitable donation. Automating your philanthropy is quick, easy and better for the charity, because their cashflow is more predictable.

1,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/31/easy-wins-want-to-sleep-better-try-a-short-gentle-stretch-before-bed,Sun 30 Jan 2022 16.30,"Easy wins: want to sleep better? Try a short, gentle stretch before bed","There are a hundred reasons why any one of us may struggle to sleep, and there are nearly as many remedies to match. Without wanting to sound like a snake oil salesperson, I have found one small change that all of us could make, that truly works: a short stretch before bed.Studies have shown that low level physical activity and meditation practice that use gentle stretching like yoga or tai chi, can help with sleep quality. And while it is good to stretch at anytime of day, establishing a gentle and quiet routine before bed can help send a signal to the brain that it is now time for sleep.Easy wins: save cash, get clothes that fit and reduce waste by tailoringRead moreBest of all, stretching doesn’t require money. There are plenty of exercise and stretching apps you could buy or subscribe to that will have routines you can follow. I have found that the subscription-based apps Sweat and Centr have good, short routines (under 10 minutes) with clear instructions to improve your form. But we’re post lockdowns now and there is a veritable platoon of personal trainers and yoga instructors on YouTube who have been giving away their classes for free to people stuck at home. Yoga with Adriene is the best known, with a huge library of videos available, but I also enjoy Zanna van Dijk’s relaxed and low-key stretches. There are plenty of others that offer routines specifically aimed at bedtime too.If you’d rather perfect your technique in person, you can also find free yoga and tai chi lessons in your local community – most of Australia’s major cities offer some in parks or public areas like Melbourne’s Federation Square – and take those lessons home.What works for you will depend on your current physical state. I am a 30-year-old who hunches over her computer for too many hours a day, and I have been to yoga classes with women in their 80s who could do a cartwheel over my poor, suffering body. But if you struggle with mobility, there are things like chair yoga to try.So clearly I’m no expert, but I have been stretching right before bed since the pandemic began and have found that I always sleep better on the nights that I do it. Whatever your ability, the key is to start gently and work your way up – because the best thing about stretching is that you see great returns quite quickly, as long as you do it routinely. And how better to establish a routine than doing your stretches just before something you do every day? Sleep well."
2,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/easy-wins-if-stillness-isnt-for-you-you-can-meditate-while-eating,Sat 29 Jan 2022 19.00,"Easy wins: ‘If stillness isn’t for you, you can meditate while eating’","I hate meditation. Well, I used to hate it. As someone who can barely sit still, the thought of sitting there doing absolutely nothing, thinking about nothing – well, that sounds like torture.Usually, when people say meditation, they are referring to sitting meditation. Where you sit with your legs crossed, focus on your breathing and empty your mind.Growing up around Buddhist temples, meditation always seemed like a bit of a punishment to me. Time out. But as I got older and started listening to the nuns that watched me grow up, I learned that meditation is so much more than doing nothing.Easy wins: want to save three lives in 10 minutes? Give bloodRead more“Meditation is hard work,” says Venerable Dr Juewei, a Buddhist nun at the Nan Tien Temple in Wollongong, but she believes her 20 years of experience in meditation have helped her keep “calm in spite of disappointments, and steady in executing [her] tasks”.But in our busy lives, between work or class, raising kids or maintaining a social life, how can we find time to stay mindful, aware and calm?When I was a Buddhist scripture teacher, I always began and ended my classes with a minute of pause to “check in” and “check out”, which helped students reset their minds for the next activity. Juewei says this helps people “transit from one activity to the next” and “pausing allows us to wrap up the previous activity and recalibrate for the new one”.The process is very straightforward. You can choose how long you want to do it for, though I recommend around two to five minutes. All you need to do is find a safe and comfortable space, sit with your feet grounded and flat and breathe slowly. Your eyes can be open or closed.Once you’re in position, bring your attention to all the sensations of your body. Are you sore? Does your head feel heavy?Then bring your attention to the events that have brought you to this moment. How do they make you feel?Throughout this process of observation. Don’t linger on any one sensation or thought, you are just making note of them and moving on.Easy wins: spend five minutes a day to score an edible garden and an obscene amount of joyRead moreIf stillness isn’t for you, you can meditate while eating, writing, gardening or drawing. The key, however, is concentration. When you give something the awareness and concentration to realise its causes and effects, that is meditation. Juewei’s favourite form of meditation is sky meditation.“When I look into the sky, it reminds me of boundless creativity and possibilities, so that I do not get too attached to any circumstance, and that we are all connected under the same sky. Clouds changing shape and location teaches me impermanence.”She says it’s also “great for my eyes which are often tired from computer overuse”, and most of us can relate to that."
3,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/i-reclaimed-my-birth-name-in-my-mid-20s-and-discovered-why-what-we-call-ourselves-matters,Sat 29 Jan 2022 16.00,I reclaimed my birth name – and discovered why what we call ourselves really matters,"My name is Camilla, so why, for the first 25 years of my life, did everyone call me Mandy? My Jamaican mother loathed the name Camilla. She said my Nigerian father chose the name, but she thought Camilla sounded too damn serious and upper-class. And she was right. Growing up in Luton in the 70s and 80s, there weren’t too many Camillas knocking about the council estates of Bedfordshire. My friends’ names were plain and simple. They were called Debbie, Tracey, Jean. They were easy on the ear. Or their names were culturally appropriate – Jyoti, Shabana, Patience. But Camilla? It might have been the name written on my birth certificate, but my mother had other ideas. She had a plan. And it was hatched in the months after my birth – a new name.But there were caveats. Unlike Camilla, the new name had to be popular, jolly and understated, with preferably two syllables. So, she drew up a list of potentials: Donna, Paula, Charmaine, Joanne. Then bingo, she came up with the name: Mandy. Not Amanda, but Mandy. Plain. Simple. Easy on the ear, Mandy. Camilla wasn’t changed by deed poll, instead, my unofficial “new name” seeped into everyday life. Mandy seamlessly embedded itself on to the register at primary and secondary school, university and around the water cooler. The name Camilla became a relic of the past, a family joke, dragged out at Christmas like eggnog.And what about my middle name? Camilla might be quintessentially British, but my middle name isn’t. It’s unashamedly Nigerian, and once my mother divorced the perpetrator of my first name debacle, my middle name joined Camilla in the names trash bin. She said my middle name – Adebisi – “screamed ethnic”, and if I wrote it on future job applications, it would be chucked into the “not one of us pile”. Mum said I should initialise Adebisi. In her opinion, the letter A gave choices. My middle name could be Abbie, Alice, Annie. Plain names. Assimilated names – AKA not foreign-sounding.Names matter. We all appreciate a good name. They hold a strange fascination and intrigue. When we’re introduced to someone, we can’t help ourselves, we don’t want to, but we form judgments because names carry all kinds of juicy information. Dr Rebecca Gregory from the Institute for Name-Studies says, “Socrates and Plato wrote about names in some of the earliest western philosophy but, historically, given names in the UK were drawn from an established pool of names (an onomasticon), which came from a few main origins: biblical sources, some from classical sources and others from vocabulary words.”But as we’ve become culturally and linguistically diverse, our naming conventions have changed. They’ve become varied and complex. We’ve witnessed the rise of the wacky name – Solo, Exton, Sixtus. The penchant for creating names from words or places – Apple, Chicago, Atom. Nature-inspired names – Willow, Sky, River. And the biggie – the influence of television on names. As Gregory says, “In 1996, there were no baby girls named Arya in England and Wales, but in 2019 it peaked at 427, and I think we all know why that is.”Saying my name felt dishonest. I wanted to say, ‘but I’m not Mandy’Names fall in and out of fashion. My mother-in-law was born in the 1930s and named Shirley, after Shirley Temple, but Shirley is outdated for our modern naming tastes – although there is some appetite for old-fashioned first names with a whiff of a “vintage, royal vibe”. According to the Office for National Statistics, the name Archie leapfrogged into the upper echelons of baby-name popularity courtesy of Meghan and Harry.But why was the reaction to Camilla so extreme? Why didn’t my mother simply shorten it to Milla, like Becky for Rebecca, Jimmy for James, Tan for Tanya? And why Mandy? When I hit the gobby, hormonal, arms-folded-across-the-chest teens, I asked my mother why she didn’t call me Molly, Maureen or Mary. They possessed the required two syllables. Why Mandy? In response, my mother hummed the song Mandy for a few moments and said, “If it’s good enough for Barry Manilow, it’s good enough for you. You’re Mandy. It means lovable. It’s a great name.”After that how could I disclose the truth? I liked the name Camilla. It was glamorous. Cool. The name Mandy didn’t fit. Most times I felt like I’d squeezed into a pair of ill-fitting, size-six jeans and the zip was breaking. When I said my name it felt dishonest. I wanted to say, hold on wait a minute, it’s not – I’m not Mandy. But I realised this might sound crazy. So I persevered. Everyone knew me as Mandy. I was Mandy, goddamit.I made a Herculean effort to love the name. It’s not a terrible name. In my teens, I searched out fellow Mandys, and the only Mandys I came across were Mandy Smith and Mandy Rice-Davies, and I later found out Rice-Davies’s first name wasn’t even Mandy, it was Marilyn. At 18, I went through a phase of Mandy-spelling experimentation. Out went dull Mandy, in came Mandi, then Mandie; I even added a double ee combo at the end; Mandee. I tried shortening it, but Mand didn’t quite cut it.I told a few friends – and for the first time in years my name fittedBy the time I got to university, first names got serious. Slews of confident students hung around lecture halls sprouting elongated names with more than two syllables – Alessandra, Henrietta, Viviana. So I thought I’d join them. I took the plunge. I introduced myself to someone as Camilla, only to be told I didn’t look like a Camilla. “What does a Camilla look like?” I asked. They replied, “Red-haired. Pale-skinned. Freckles. Celtic-looking. Wears tweed. Likes Enya. They don’t look like you.” After that, I kept my real name to myself. I didn’t divulge my first name to anyone else except my boyfriend – now husband. On our first date, I blurted out my real first name and he said: “Mandy’s a nice enough name, but Camilla’s beautiful.”But how could I reclaim Camilla? Everyone knew me as Mandy. The name was intertwined with my sense of self. But was it? Gregory says: “People adapt or change their names to suit the person they turn out to be. They want to use a name that fits their sense of identity.” So that’s what I did. In my mid-20s, I reclaimed my name. There wasn’t any fanfare. There was no Stars in Their Eyes, “Tonight Matthew, I’m going to be Camilla,” moment. I told a few close friends. I took a deep breath, explained my complicated name history and said, “Can you call me Camilla, not Mandy?” When I’d finished the feeling was similar to someone placing a warm blanket over my shoulders. For the first time in years my name fitted.The psychotherapist Sarah Parkin says: “When we feel we ‘fit’ our names, the effects can be hugely empowering and transformational.” And it was, but when you change name midway through your life, there’s bound to be the occasional blip or hiccup. Swathes of friends who knew me as Mandy had to adapt to my new first-name status, and they often forgot. Sometimes I forgot, too. I’d introduce myself as Mandy, then Camilla, and for a while, confusion reigned. Camilla went through a long bedding-in process. For those first few years, it was easier to say, “Call me whatever you feel comfortable with.” Parkin says: “Feeling comfortable with your name signals to the world you’ve found who you truly are.” For me, taking responsibility for my middle name and my actual first name, not a randomly chosen one, felt life-affirming.But not to one person – my mother. For her, the name Camilla comes with ex-husband baggage. And there’s another, perhaps more significant, reason for her reluctance to call me Camilla – Diana, Princess of Wales. As Princess Diana’s number one super-fan, she finds the name synonymous with Charles’s other woman. This seals the deal for my mother’s anti-Camilla sentiment. No further ammunition is required.Over the years, I have tried and failed to soothe her anxiety over my real name. On the few occasions she calls me Camilla, my mother morphs into Hyacinth Bucket meets Lady Danbury. She puts on her faux posh voice and, on her lips, my name sounds like she’s caught a rotten oyster in her throat. I might be Camilla to most people, but for her, I will forever and always be plain, simple, two syllables, easy on the ear, Mandy. @CamillaBalshaw"
4,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/28/cold-baths-cherry-juice-and-sleep-the-secret-to-staying-fit-in-your-40s,Fri 28 Jan 2022 11.00,"Cold baths, cherry juice and sleep: the secret to staying fit in your 40s","Six years ago it looked as if Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s footballing career was approaching the final whistle. After Sweden’s early exit from Euro 2016, the striker announced his retirement from international competition. At 34, he was getting on a bit for an elite athlete. Cut to November 2021 and, days after firing in a spectacular free-kick for his club, AC Milan, Sweden’s record goalscorer was helping keep alive his country’s hopes of making the next World Cup. The retirement chat was over. “I am trying to prove that 40 is just a number,” he said.Ibrahimovic had joined what feels like a growing club: the quadragenarian athlete holding back the clock. In an era of ever more punishing professional sport, these twilight stars seem to challenge notions that youth trumps all else. Members include American football superstar Tom Brady (44), the tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams (41, 40), Roger Federer (40), and Oksana Chusovitina (46), the eight-time Olympic gymnast from Uzbekistan.There have, of course, always been athletic outliers. But is something else happening? Is it improved nutrition, technology or psychology? Or are sports stars just better at looking after themselves? What are the secrets of prolonged high performance – and what can everyday fortysomethings do to stay healthy during what can be an exhausting yet pivotal decade?Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.I’m only six months younger than Ibrahimovic. I bounded through my 20s and early 30s without a care for much at all. I cycled, ran and swam. I now juggle work stress and two children under four. I ride when I can, a few times a week on a soulless indoor bike, but if I’m not at my desk, I’m picking up toys, food or wriggling humans off the floor. I have watched a slightly dodgy hip and back get worse. I can’t run, feel uncomfortable on the bike and take ibuprofen to help me sleep pain-free.Sweden and AC Milan’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 40, has returned from injury and won’t stop ‘until I am kicked out.’ Photograph: Fabrizio Carabelli/LiveMedia/Rex/ShutterstockI’m also increasingly aware of my own mortality, and have told myself that 2022 – when I hit 40 – is the year I’ll sort myself out. I suspect my heart and lungs are OK, but I feel I have the physique and flexibility of a much older man. I can hear things creaking.Let’s keep things depressing for a bit. Because 40 is not just a number. “People reach a peak in most sporting events in their mid-30s,” says Stephen Harridge, professor of human and applied physiology at King’s College London. Harridge, 56, a former 400-metre hurdles runner, specialises in ageing. You then enter a “progressive decline in performance” that remains steady until your 70s (don’t ask).If an hour of intense exercise falls between a day at a desk and a session in the pub, you’re asking for troubleMeasuring this decline can be tricky. Maximum heart rates are an indicator (they fall). So are 100-metre sprint times in masters and senior races. “During the 40s we see about a 0.6-second decline in men’s and women’s times,” Harridge says. A combination of small changes, including drops in muscle mass, aerobic capacity and neuromuscular control – the way the brain conducts our muscles – add up to a drop in what is possible. In people like me, abused knees, creaky backs, feeble cores and neglected niggles can further limit performance.Scottish tennis star Andy Murray, 34, is determined to return to winning form after two hip operations. Photograph: Javier García/BPI/REX/ShutterstockThe elite twilight club has several advantages that make the difference. “The big one is what we call the physiological reserve,” says James Moore, a consultant physiotherapist and director of sport and exercise medicine at the CHHP sports clinic in central London. “They have built up a training history and an ability to listen to their bodies.” A wise head can also count. “We all love older players who can’t run as fast as they used to but have developed this incredible tactical sense, so they don’t have to run any more,” says Jeff Bercovici, author of Play On: How to Get Better With Age. See also: money. We’d all be a bit more supple if we could surround ourselves with physios, trainers, cooks and nannies. Moore, 47, had a call last summer from Andy Murray, who was trying to return to winning form after two hip operations. The Scottish tennis star’s joint woes are unusual for his age (he’s 34), but less so in Moore’s other patients, who tend to be 40-plus high-achievers. Moore reviewed Murray’s rehab and training regime to help him cope better with the inconsistent demands of tennis, where matches can go on for hours, and there may be little time to recover between rounds in a tournament. With older patients, says Moore, the challenge is getting a sense of their changing limits. Anyone, whether they’re heading to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup or KFC via a five-a-side pitch, must be smart enough to go easy – and do less – or risk an injury. Can’t match your 5km personal best from a decade ago, or lift the same in the gym? Don’t sweat it. “You have to park your ego at the door,” says Baz Moffat, former Team GB Olympic rower and co-founder of The Well, a women’s wellbeing advocacy group.Finding enjoyment in an activity is more important than what you do, as then you’ll keep at it. “Let’s not forget that the majority of people hate physical exercise,” says Alexei Sharp, 49, a former decathlete, at the FitFor gym and physiotherapy clinic in south-east London. Moore, who was head of performance for Team GB in Rio, says he has seen so many battered bodies that he can determine a patient’s problem within the first 10 minutes of a consultation. “I spend the rest of the time trying to work out a solution that fits their lifestyle and will motivate them,” he says.Enjoyment often comes from competitive sport that is fun and perhaps nostalgic – five-a-side or netball, perhaps. But if an hour of intense exercise falls between a day at a desk and a session in the pub, you’re asking for trouble. “Five-a-side is so jarring on joints and muscles,” Moore says. The key, he adds, is flushing the chemicals out of muscles that cause pain if left to linger. “Going for a five-minute jog after the match, then stretching, is way better than stretching or just going to the pub.” Serena Williams, 40, had to retire from Wimbledon last year following a hamstring injury. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action ImagesCold water also helps this flushing process by stimulating blood flow, whether it’s an ice bath, ice packs or a cold shower. Moore says elite athletes increasingly drink sour cherry juice. It contains natural anti-inflammatories that reduce muscle pain and strength loss after exertion.When pain does stop play, switching to low-impact sports such as swimming and cycling can be good for the cardiovascular system. But the loss of impact can be detrimental. Studies have shown that cartilage, including in the knees, benefits from impact as repetitive squeezing and releasing draws in fluid rich in nutrients and oxygen. Bones need impact to stay strong; studies have shown that competitive cyclists have thinner and more fragile bones than comparable runners.“It’s always a good idea not to just do one type of exercise,” Harridge says. Lifting weights and more resistance-based cycling, such as up a steep hill, can provide some impact, he adds, but regular jogs that are short enough not to trigger niggles will reduce the chances of developing brittle bones later on. Variety also means working a bigger range of muscles. I have a cyclist’s legs but the core and upper body of a lame rabbit. It’s not just about being strong, but protecting joints and promoting balanced movement throughout the body; squats and lunges, for example, strengthen muscles around the knee.It may be significant that Ibrahimovic is trained in taekwondo. His Milan teammate Paolo Maldini, who retired at 40, is also a big tennis player (he made his professional debut in 2017, aged 49, losing in the first round of a doubles tournament in Milan). Sleep is often neglected as a factor in ageing. And in this demographic, stress that results from heightened work responsibility can collide with the demands of a young family. A vicious cycle can develop; discomfort further reduces the quantity and quality of sleep, sapping energy levels. Sleep loss also contributes to a weakened immune system, and an increased chance of developing depression, dementia, type 2 diabetes and heart problems.We also produce vital hormones while sleeping, including testosterone, which has a broad range of effects in men and women, including burning fat, building muscle and strengthening bone. In short, by improving my physical state, I’ll get better sleep, which will further improve my physical state.Beyond mixing a manageable level of impact with more cardiovascular workouts, and working on my sleep and warming-down habits, there is a growing array of devices, diets and obscure protocols that promise to mitigate the effects of age. “I call them the one-percenters that contribute around the margins,” Bercovici says. Yet some have been shown to be effective. Moore is keen on Kaatsu, a form of training in which bands that restrict blood flow to muscles stimulate their growth and function. Like cold water or ice, he says handheld massage guns can also help flush out muscles after exercise.I have been advised to consult a physiotherapist for my own ailments, and be wary of following, say, a random stretching routine on YouTube that may make things worse. Targeted pilates moves, Sharp says, are what I need to rebalance my body and reduce lower-back strain. Then I can get back to running and should become stronger on the bike. And I’ll be able to lift my kids without thinking twice.‘All efforts should go towards repairing the trust’: how to survive an affairRead moreBecause the good news is, while elite athletes have to eke out a few more years at the top after being used to supreme performance, it’s perfectly possible for amateurs to peak in their 40s. “You see a lot of people take up new sports then and find they’re on that rewarding part of the curve where they’re getting better and better,” says Bercovici.Perhaps Ibrahimovic will pivot to completing an iron man in a couple of years. Meanwhile, he’ll play football for as long as he can. “I don’t want to stop until I’m kicked out, well and truly finished,” he said of his heroic comeback for Sweden. Two weeks later, he admitted to a certain frailty in an interview with the Guardian: “Every day I wake up, I have pain everywhere,” he said. There’s hope for us all."

He’d had a degenerative condition, but was totally in denial – and while it was a known excuse for his moods and lack of interest in his family, he did little in his lifestyle to mitigate its effects.After he died, we discovered there was a dominant gene he could have passed to his children. My brother and I have been tested – my sister does not want to be – and my brother was found to be positive. After I had my genetic test, I was advised to contact our extended family. Thinking I was being honest, I emailed our cousins the information, sharing my brother’s diagnosis paperwork to help them get referrals.Now, my brother is livid that I shared his medical history. I’ve apologised for sharing his information  but not for sharing my dad’s. I can’t believe our wider family don’t deserve to know this. A dominant gene is relevant – particularly because it indicates a causal link, but not a definite diagnosis, meaning it could be dormant and be passed down.I’m writing to ask if I did the right thing and how best to move forward. I’m tired of the legacy my father has left behind but I feel like I’m being punished for doing the right thing.Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.I’m sorry to hear about your dad and the legacy he’s left you with. I wonder if you’ve had the results of your test? That must weigh heavily on your mind. But your brother’s testing positive must be a big worry for him, and it sounds, by your own admission, as if that hasn’t been acknowledged.It’s clear that you’re very angry with your dad, and he’s not here to take it. I wonder if you are now misdirecting it.To help me answer you I consulted psychotherapist Katherine Walker (psychotherapy.org.uk) and lawyers Jonathan Wheeler and Amanda Garner from Bolt Burdon Kemp. While Walker empathised with what you were trying to do, we all agreed that sharing your brother’s information without his consent was a no-no.It’s important to realise that what you did was wrong and no amount of justification is going to make this rightThe fact remains you could have satisfied your need for helping others, and sharing the information about the degenerative condition, without involving your brother and certainly without passing on his medical data. As Wheeler and Garner pointed out, passing on his papers without his consent is a breach of data protection laws. Your brother could, if he wanted to, make a complaint about you to the Information Commissioner’s Office, although the chances of it being interested in this (it mainly concerns itself with organisations leaking data) are minimal at best. However, it’s important to realise that what you did was wrong and no amount of justification can make this right.“You need to own what you’ve done and take responsibility for it,” says Walker. “You’re trying to correct the generational pattern and right wrongs of the past, but when we do this we sometimes overcompensate. While you’ve avoided secretive behaviour, you’ve invaded your brother’s privacy in pursuit of the truth.”Walker suggested you try to explain to your brother that you did it with the best intentions but admit that “you went too far and his information wasn’t yours to share”.My mum has Alzheimer’s.

He had secret affairs and flirtations that I was suspicious about, but if I brought it up, I was called crazy and accused of sabotaging our relationship. It wasn’t until our first child was born, after four years of marriage, that he felt extreme guilt and remained faithful. Shortly after baby number two was born three years later,   he told me that he was polyamorous and has a crush at work. There are times when he emotionally pulls away and this is when I think he desires more than just me. When I told him I was ready to break up, he claimed he would do anything not to lose me. We started dating again but, after two weeks, he asked me to consider having a threesome. I feel I have reached a point where I am ready to settle down and that is why I married him. But it appears to me that he does not feel the same way. I cannot understand why – if he loves me like he says he does – I am not enough?Some people find monogamy impossible. They are just wired that way. In fact, monogamy is difficult for most people. I understand that trust is very important to you, yet right from the beginning you knew your husband was rarely just with you. You have stayed with him and had children, and there is clearly deep love between you so I am wondering why have you now reached a point where his non-monogamous lifestyle is insufferable? In reality, he is not going to change. Your choices are to separate, or stay with him and make the most of what is good between you – despite the torture. You would do well to consider what it is about you that binds you to this constant state of disappointment and longing. After you understand that, you may make the healthier choice.

7,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/13/farewell-mariella-i-wanted-to-say-thanks,Sun 13 Jun 2021 06.00,Farewell Mariella: ‘I wanted to say thanks’,"From 2002 Dear Mariella, I just wanted to let you know that not long after your column started I wrote to you. I was in utter despair as my husband had left and I think I was having a breakdown. I thought at the time your reply was quite harsh. However, you were right, I did need to get a grip and concentrate on my children.Years later, everything worked out in the end, I became stronger, we sorted out our relationship properly and we have been happy. Yes there have been ups and downs and our son, who was not quite two when I wrote to you, was later diagnosed with a very rare and serious condition. There is nothing like having a sick child to put everything in perspective and we have totally focused on doing everything we can to get him the best help and support. He is now 10 and doing well at the moment.After the past few years, despite the pain and heartbreak, I feel as strong as an ox and I have learned so much about myself. Thank you for helping me all those years ago. I needed to wake up – and I did.2008Dear Mariella, I wanted to get back in touch with regards to a letter of mine you responded to in 2008. I mentioned that I’d thought of killing myself. Obviously I’m not dead, but I wanted to say that I’m better, I’m happy, and nothing I feared has come to pass.I wanted to say thanks. I took your advice to heart and I kept a diary of my progress, which I’m still updating after so many years. Looking back on it I can see how much I’ve grown up; how strange and irrational those times were. Looking forward I can see how much I’m growing, how much more I want to learn and explore. I want to live.2014Dear Mariella, your response to a 16-year-old girl experiencing depression moved me greatly. I am head of year at a secondary school and it seems that every week I am dealing with a teenager who is experiencing a mental health problem. I fear that recent cuts have caused havoc for many of our students and often I feel powerless that my advice is half-baked. (The training courses I have been on never capture the raw vulnerability that teenagers with mental health problems feel.) I often go home feeling angry and frustrated that I cannot do more to help. Your response was refreshing, thought-provoking and, more importantly, full of compassion. I hope you don’t mind, but I will be plagiarising your advice!2014Dear Mariella, I’m writing to say thank you very much for your thoughtful reply. I am normally very cynical about the internet and the false, too-easy sense of immediate connection that interactions over it can be imbued with – but it has been very important to me, reading not just your response, but the replies of other readers on the website. Something that didn’t even occur to me was that there might be men out there who might reply, and suggest what my boyfriend might think of me telling him my story – boyfriends and husbands who knew and loved other women who’d been raped.Lots of answers seemed to come from women who had chosen to tell, and had regretted it, but I don’t think there was a single response from a male reader who said anything except that they were glad their partners had told them. I found that very comforting.This has been truly meaningful for me.2016Dear Mariella, I had wanted to write to say thank you for your column for a number of years, but have never found the right moment. I was in an emotionally, and sometimes physically, abusive relationship for six years and never felt brave enough to leave. Your column helped a lot throughout this time, and your sensible, straightforward advice on many issues slowly spurred me on to make the changes that I found so difficult. It seemed like you were sitting in my living room with a glass of wine, giving some harsh but much needed advice.Anyway, I left and I have never looked back. In this time I have completed my formal education, found a wonderful, kind man who makes me laugh and we have just found out we are expecting a baby. Whoop whoop!2016Dear Mariella, I’ve just read your response to the dilemma, “My ex-wife is angry…” I did so as another way to beat myself – I’m an ex-wife, and I’m sure as hell angry with my ex, who could easily be the man who wrote in. I thought perhaps it would be salutary to see things from the ex-husband’s point of view. I’m so pleased you pulled that man up on his constant self-referencing, and politely but firmly told him his attitude was plain wrong. Thank you. After a shitty weekend of narcissistic male behaviour and runaway preteens, and me constantly at home, on my own, waiting to put the children back together again, it has truly perked me up. I feel validated. 2020Dear Mariella, I felt compelled to let you know how much I enjoy reading your column on dealing with life’s and love’s many challenges. You always write with such eloquence and thoughtfulness (and not little humour), to provide balanced and, if necessary, hard-hitting advice to those who seek it. Many of the responses you’ve written have resonated with me. I often read them, then return later. Thank you, too, for reminding me that the daily challenges we each face in life are often mirrored in those encountered by so many others."

But, when we arrived at our Dorset campsite last summer, the tent would not go up because the inflatable poles were perished and leaking. After spending several hours on hold to Outwell in Denmark we were forced to buy a £380 replacement in nearby Poole.Since then, I have been trying to resolve this with Outwell. It has told me that it no longer stocks replacement poles, and because of Brexit it can’t collect the tent. Its only solution is to offer to sell us a new one at a discount.I am upset about the money wasted – and hardly need a third tent – but I’m much more upset about the lack of concern about what we should do with the non-functioning one.It is huge, weighing more than 40kg, and the idea of sending it to landfill is awful. We only used it four times – our previous one lasted 25 years.SA, LancasterMost people would expect a £1,374 tent to last more than four trips. Outwell, while it was very sorry, hasn’t really come up with a solution. It tells me it had tried to source replacement tubes but had failed. It has offered a 65% discount on a new tent – the same, it claims, as it would have cost to replace the tubes. It again blamed post-Brexit customs problems for being unable to collect your tent.I spoke to the inflatable tents expert at Attwoolls Outdoors, near Gloucester, who, amazingly, knew your (early) model.He said that Outwell had since changed the design of the tubes and thought it unlikely you would find replacements, or that the universal pipes that now exist would fit.The retailer you bought the tent from is responsible under the Consumer Rights Act but I suspect you won’t get a better offer than the 65% discount if you go to court.I’d be trying to find an ingenious local person who may be able to fix it.

I like to make a circular route starting in Fotheringhay up to Nassington, on to Yarwell and Kingscliff, then head back via Apethorpe Palace and Woodnewton. This route is about 14 miles, but you can lengthen and shorten the route depending on your energy level by adding in or taking out villages. I like to rely on the signposts to navigate, rather than my phone. Make sure to look out for hares, red kites and fallow deer along the route, and post-ride there are some lovely local pubs with open fires.Imogen ChappelowEpping Forest, with refreshmentsAll skill levels … cyclists follow a quiet lane in Epping Forest. Photograph: Andrew Bailey/AlamyThere is a route through Epping Forest from Epping to Loughton that is wide, well-marked and has enough flat and hilly terrain to keep all skill levels happy. Aside from that, it is well served for refreshments by the Forest Gate Inn at one end and the Victoria Tavern at the other. The flora and fauna is always stunning, but in winter the quieter runs and stark beauty means any encounter with wildlife is accentuated.KeiranIce-free along the ThamesYou may pass … the Thames Barrier near Woolwich. Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyAs a cyclist in London, I spend most of my summer weekends escaping to the delights of the North Downs or the Surrey Hills. However, in winter, the higher roads can stay icy, even when those in town are clear. So to avoid the winter road roulette, I take to the Thames cycle path. This runs from source to sea, but for a lunchtime or post-work training ride I tend to take in the sections between Tower Bridge and Woolwich. They are flat and well paved and tend to stay ice-free, with plenty of warm drink and snack options to keep those winter miles fuelled! You also get to admire a world heritage site in Greenwich as well as some spectacular engineering as you roll past the Thames flood barrier.DanProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Sawday's stayShow Guardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Photograph: Realimage/AlamyMy local “round the block” ride takes in the glorious Dyffryn Ogwen (Ogwen valley), Dyffryn Mymbyr (Mymbyr valley) and Pen-Y-Pass, towards Llanberis village. Setting out in winter is like heading into Mordor, with snow-capped peaks, moody purple-grey clouds, and the sight of Tryfan ridge, like a dragon’s back. As it opens out, you can enjoy the lovely, steady descent to Capel Curig village, hanging a right, you pass the Mymbyr lakes with the Snowdon Horseshoe ahead, before coming up and over the side of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), and the exhilarating soar down the other side. With drama and mountains at every turn, this ride never gets any less breathtaking.Marieke HofsteedeA winter whirl around Lake Maggiore, ItalyLooking across Lake Maggiore near Arona. Photograph: AleMasche72/Getty ImagesThe best cycling of my life was done a few years ago ago when I retired, packing my bags and a bike to cycle around Italy, top-to-toe. The most energising, invigorating route was a winter whirl around Lake Maggiore. The microclimate and sparkling January sunshine – glimmering on the lake on one side and bouncing off snow-topped Alpine peaks on the other – were an inspiration to keep pedalling. Start at Arona on the Piedmont side, then head up to Stresa, with its lovely belle époque hotels – feel free to stop for a warming cappuccino or grappa, as I did! You can then bike round the lake, passing though Locarno in Switzerland, or put your bike on a ferry to the Lombard side.BillGorgeous sea views, Dundee to MontroseA beach on the way to Montrose. Photograph: Naomi ClarkeBlow the cobwebs away on a sunny winter’s day. Starting from the V&A Dundee (schedule a visit before or after your ride), watch the winter sunrise over the Tay Estuary before taking the coastal path north on Sustrans Route 1. The 35 miles to Montrose include a mix of dedicated cycle paths and quiet country lanes with gorgeous sea views keeping you company the whole way. Have a picnic lunch sheltered in the dunes on the expansive sandy beach of Lunan Bay before finishing at the Montrose Basin reserve, where in October, around 80,000 pink-footed geese arrive for winter. Admire the sea views once again on the return journey by train from Montrose to Dundee.Naomi ClarkeBicycles across the Bosphorus, IstanbulIstanbul in winter. Photograph: NickIstanbul is a scenic location for a winter bike ride and you can now travel 80 miles of designated cycle paths there. The city itself has an expansive cycling route on its Asian side. Starting in Kadıköy, with views over to Europe, there is a nearly uninterrupted landscaped path along the coast of the Bosphorus and Marmara Sea that takes cyclists through Caddebostan, Bostancı, and up to Pendik. In winter the smog lifts to become sparkling sunshine and you can stop for a warming tea and sesame-seed bread along the route. I rented a bike from Isbike and put it on a ferry to the car-free Princes Islands, for calm, easy cycling with views over two continents.NickLancashire hotspotMorecambe Bay in winter with a view to the Lake District. Photograph: Graham DeanLess than a third of the Bay Cycle Way’s 81-mile route is traffic-free, but the 16-mile section between Carnforth and Glasson Dock is mostly off-road. It follows a canal towpath, Morecambe promenade and disused railway tracks, and offers the best views across Morecambe Bay. There are plenty of convenient places to park, including at Glasson Dock, Conder Green and in Morecambe. There is also an abundance of refreshment stops, though not all the cafes are open during winter (you’ll always find something in Lancaster and Morecambe). As Morecambe promenade has been very busy during the last two summers due to an influx of visitors, the ride will be much more pleasant in winter.Graham DeanEast Midlands meanderIndustrial landscape … the power station at Ratcliffe-on-Soar.

I start in the Derbyshire town of Long Eaton, heading south across the River Trent into Leicestershire, where a look over the shoulder early in the morning will see the sun rising over the cooling towers. From there the choices are limitless, but why not make a three-counties of it? Head east and you’re soon across the Soar and into Nottinghamshire, where snaking lanes and wooded hillsides await. The return westwards takes in some picturesque villages with tempting cafe stops, before the turrets of Ratcliffe beckon the weary cyclist home.MichaelPedalling with persimmons, Spain Photograph: John MartinNot your usual bike trip.

Initially you’ll find cactus and thyme-edged tracks, then Alpujarran ways with windfall treats of almonds, avocados, and persimmons, and finally vultures circling over thick rainforest.

The new organisation will inspect what is built and publish annual reports ranking councils on their performance, intended to mimic the role of Ofsted with schools.“We’ll have the engineering capacity to say, ‘Let’s have a look at the design and we’ll help you,’” Boardman told the Guardian. “But we’ll also have the power to say: ‘It’s not good enough.’”Boardman, who has given up his role with the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, in which from 2017 he was the region’s cycling and walking commissioner and then transport commissioner, said his aim was to create “a quiet revolution” in how people get around.“Walking and cycling is the foundation of any sustainable transport system. You can encourage people to change all you like, but when it still takes bravery to cross a street, then people are going to drive,” he said.Chris Boardman at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona after winning gold in the individual pursuit. Photograph: BTS“This is about enabling, and encouraging once you have the safe space. The message is: this is for people doing normal things in normal clothes, just having the choice of not having to do it in a car. And it’s in all our interests to face up to that.”As well as bike paths on main roads, Active Travel England will set out standards for schemes intended to reverse the increasing dominance of motor traffic on smaller roads, where navigation apps have led to an increase in rat-running.“We have a finite amount of space, and there’s over 20bn more miles being driven around homes than there were a decade ago,” Boardman said. “We’ve co-opted local streets to soak up traffic that roads were never designed for. It’s not going to be easy to unpick, but it’s really worth it.”About a quarter of households in cities have no car, Boardman noted: “These are their roads and streets, too. Kids don’t have a choice to drive – they have to be driven. And these are their roads and streets, too, and they have the right to use them.”How a myth about London bike lanes and congestion took offRead moreBased in York with a staff of just under 100, ATE will also offer councils advice on dealing with any backlash over new cycle routes, or motor traffic reduction measures such as low-traffic neighbourhoods.Some schemes have seen negative media coverage, as well as local opposition which, while generally involving a small number of people, has spooked some councils into reversing changes.Boardman said: “We always lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of people want this. Every survey you see says, yes, I want my kids to be able to cycle and walk to school, but at the moment I don’t feel able to do anything else but drive them.“Change isn’t going to be easy, but it’s essential. And it’s inevitable.”"
11,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/revealed-many-common-omega-3-fish-oil-supplements-are-rancid,Mon 17 Jan 2022 06.45,Revealed: many common omega-3 fish oil supplements are ‘rancid’,"More than one in 10 fish oil supplements tested from among 60 large retail brands are rancid, while nearly half are just under the recommended maximum limit, according to independent tests.Conducted over several years by Labdoor, which analyses vitamins and supplements based on criteria such as purity, label accuracy and nutritional value, the tests measured common US-branded fish oils, available globally, against international voluntary standards of rancidity.Some fish oils recorded levels 11 times higher than recommended limits.Rancidity arises when a product becomes oxidised. In fish oil, a rancid example can involve a strong fishy taste and rotten smell.“It was fairly frequent,” said Dan Mark, Labdoor’s research director. “For us, they would start to smell and feel off.”‘It’s mind-boggling’: the hidden cost of our obsession with fish oil pillsRead moreThe rancidity is often masked by flavourings, which are added to most fish oils to reduce the fishy taste and smell.Other evaluations are producing similar results. A combination of global studies since 2015 showed that an average of 20% of fish oil products have excess oxidation.“That means if you go out and buy fish oil, there is at least a one in five chance of you getting an oil more oxidised than the recommended level,” said Dr Ben Albert, fellow at the University of Auckland, whose research focuses on the health effects of fish oil.Fish oils are extremely popular, particularly in the US, where they are consumed by more than a third of adults who use dietary supplements. They are touted as an alternative to eating fish for getting omega-3 nutrients, and as beneficial for heart disease, improving brain function and strengthening metabolism. Many have flavourings added.Vitamins and health supplements at a Walmart store in the US, where fish oils are a very popular supplement. Photograph: RSBPhoto/Alamy“Flavouring is added to fish oils to help mask fishy smell and taste, and … might make more oxidised oils more palatable for people to take, so it could also be used to hide oxidation of the oil,” said Albert.Albert said smell was not a reliable indicator of oxidation. “Some fish oils will smell more than others, but if they don’t smell bad, that doesn’t tell you it’s not oxidised,” he said.Given that the supplement market is largely unregulated, voluntary limits for oxidative quality were created by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3 (GOED), an industry body with about 170 members that aims to increase consumption of omega-3s.The recommended limit was set at 26, an arbitrary and unitless measure of oxidation, and is the most common and strictest worldwide benchmark for fish oil quality. So, the higher the number, the more rancid the oil, though it is important to note that it is an indication of quality, not safety.The GOED maintains that the majority of its members’ fish oil products are within the limits.But according to Labdoor’s analysis, conducted on products between 2014 and 2018, fish oils under the brand names Carlson Labs and Puritan’s Pride, which retail in chains such as Walmart and Amazon, had rancidity grades significantly higher than the suggested limits: 281.8 for Carlson’s Norwegian cod liver oil and 37.1 for Puritan Pride’s soft-gel fish oil.Other brands that exceeded limits were Oceanblue, with an oxidation value of 73.9, and Nature’s Answer, which tested at 34.4. Half of all products tested by Labdoor bordered on the GOED limit, at an average of 24.4.Oxidation is a normal process in all oils that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fish oil is particularly susceptible to oxidising, which happens faster when exposed to heat, air or light.It is also prone to oxidisation because of its long supply chain, which often lacks appropriate preventive measures. Most fish oil comes from anchovetas in Peru. Annual catches exceed 4m tonnes, mainly used for aquaculture, with an estimated 38,000 tonnes of anchovy oil extracted for supplements, according to GOED.Unloading anchovies at Peru’s northern port of Chimbote. Most fish oil comes from Peruvian anchovetas. Photograph: Enrique Castro-Mendivil/ReutersOnce harvested, the oil is often sent to China for extraction and distillation, before coming back to North America or Europe to be packaged. At each step, the oil must be handled quickly and at low temperatures.“To prevent oxidation, you have to focus on it from the beginning when the fish is caught, because when the oil is oxidised you can’t restore it back to freshness,” said ​​Bo Martinsen, an omega-3 specialist and co-founder of the fish oil company Omega3 Innovations.Whether rancid fish oil is harmful remains unclear. So far, sporadic studies have shown that highly oxidised fish oil capsules can have a negative impact on cholesterol levels. When tested in high doses in animals, the oils were shown to have toxic effects.“It certainly tells us that oxidation changes the way these oils work,” Albert said. “The fact that we know from animals that the effects change when it’s oxidised would mean that a reasonable human consumer would want to avoid oxidised oils – but they can’t do that themselves.”Whether it is harmful or not, rancid oil is likely to be less effective than fresh fish oil, according to Martinsen. He points to changes in the chemical composition of highly oxidised oils that may reduce their benefits. Again, however, the research is not conclusive.Licence to krill: the destructive demand for a ‘better’ fish oilRead moreThe GOED has been pushing back on criticism for years. After a 2015 study by Albert noted that 92% of products in New Zealand exceeded one of the recommended oxidation limits, it conducted its own replication study in 2017 and the results were much lower, with less than 20% of the products exceeding the limits.Gerard Bannenberg, director of technical compliance at GOED, said: “I don’t think people need to be concerned about oxidation. The level we’re talking about is very low. Even if the product is slightly oxidised, it’s very unlikely that it will harm our health.”Only Nature’s Answer responded to the Guardian’s request for comment, maintaining that typical results for their fish oil ranges have a total oxidation value of 10. Any results over 25, such as in Labdoor’s tests, indicate improper handling and storage, they say, which is likely to be in the supply chain before being tested.Albert said: “The GOED recommended limit is not a magical number that means something important for how that pill will act in your body. In principle, we should have regulatory levels at which health effects change, but we don’t know those levels.”In general, he warned, fish oil supplements are hard to trust."
